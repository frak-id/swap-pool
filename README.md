## Features üåü

- **Pool Per Contract Mechanism**: Enhanced flexibility by allowing a dedicated pool for each contract.
- **In-Memory Accounting**: Optimized performance by handling account balances and transactions in memory.
- **EIP-2612 Permit Signature Support**: Integrated support for EIP-2612 permit signatures, enabling better user experience and security.
- **Unified Token Abstraction**: With the new `TokenLib.sol`, seamlessly manage both ERC-20 tokens and native chain tokens using a singular user-defined value type.

## Contract Structure üìú

```plaintext
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MonoPool.sol               - Contract containing a single pool
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Ops.sol                    - Contains the list of all available operations (Ops)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AccounterLib.sol       - Library containing the in-memory accounting logic (account changes, get changes, reset changes etc)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PoolLib.sol            - Related to all the pool logic (add/rm liquidity, trigger swap)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SwapLib.sol            - Library containing the stuff related to swap operation computation
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ TokenLib.sol           - Unified token type for ERC-20 and native tokens abstraction
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ encoder
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DecoderLib.sol         - Helps decode data for each operation
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ EncoderLib.sol         - Assists off-chain users to build their program. Not for on-chain use. (Gas inefficient)
```

Always remember: Use `EncoderLib` exclusively in off-chain scenarios for optimal gas efficiency.

## How It Works üß†

### Internal Flash Accounting üí°

- The pool employs an internal accounting system to keep track of balance changes for two specific tokens, namely `token0` and `token1`, during the course of a transaction block (flash execution). This seamless tracking is possible thanks to the abstraction provided by the `TokenLib.sol`.
- Instead of making changes to the Ethereum state immediately, the contract first tracks net balance changes internally.
- After all operations have been executed, the contract then applies the final net changes to the actual balances of `token0` and `token1` at the end of the transaction block.
- This approach aims to minimize gas usage, as frequent state changes (storage operations) are generally costly in terms of gas.

### Unified Token Management ü™ô

- With the new `TokenLib.sol`, the system has a built-in abstraction layer to handle both ERC-20 tokens and native tokens (represented by the address 0).
- This allows for seamless transfers and balance checks for both ERC-20 and native chain tokens.
- Whether interacting with ERC-20's `transfer()` and `balanceOf()` or native chain operations, the underlying logic remains abstracted, reducing complexity and potential errors.

### Program üìú

- Interactions with the pools are facilitated via the `execute(bytes program)` function.
- The "program" is essentially a serialized set of operations and follows a specific structure:
  - Every operation within this program comprises:
    - An 8-bit operation, spanning 1 byte.
    - Data pertaining to the opcode, spanning 'n' bytes.
- This encoding method ensures minimal calldata size, given that each operation might need different data amounts.

### Operations üîß

- An 8-bit operation specifier contains two parts:
  - The first 4 bits (half) represent the operation ID (Op Code).
  - The latter 4 bits represent flags.
- Thus, there's the potential for up to 16 primary operations. Each can interpret 4 additional flags.
- Parameters are always packed tightly.
- Encoding of individual operations can be found in the `EncoderLib`.
- **Note**: Operation names are from the pool's viewpoint. For example, "send" means the pool is transferring assets to an external party.

### Masks and Flags üé≠

- Flags are used to modify or extend the behavior of an operation. 
- Masks, like `SWAP_DIR = 0x01`, are used to work with flags. For example:
  - To set a flag on an operation: `operationCode |= SWAP_DIR`
  - To check if a flag is set on an operation: `operationCode & SWAP_DIR != 0`

## Supported Operations üîß

The `Ops` library delineates all the operations permissible by the swap contracts. These operations are enumerated as constants. 

### List of Operations

- **SWAP Operation**: Used for swapping transactions.
  - **Operation Code**: `SWAP = 0x00`
  - **Direction Flag**: 
    - Extracts the direction of the operation.
    - `SWAP_DIR = 0x01`
  - **Deadline Flag**: 
    - Add a deadline to the swap operation.
    - `SWAP_DEADLINE = 0x02`

- **SEND_ALL Operation**: Allows the pool to send all tokens to the user.
  - **Operation Code**: `SEND_ALL = 0x10`

- **RECEIVE_ALL Operation**: Allows the user to send all tokens to the pool.
  - **Operation Code**: `RECEIVE_ALL = 0x20`

- **SEND Operation**: Allows the pool to send tokens to the user.
  - **Operation Code**: `SEND = 0x30`

- **RECEIVE Operation**: Allows the user to send tokens to the pool.
  - **Operation Code**: `RECEIVE = 0x40`

- **PERMIT_WITHDRAW_VIA_SIG Operation**: Enables permit functionality using EIP-2612.
  - **Operation Code**: `PERMIT_WITHDRAW_VIA_SIG = 0x50`

- **ADD_LIQ Operation**: Adds liquidity to the pool.
  - **Operation Code**: `ADD_LIQ = 0x60`

- **RM_LIQ Operation**: Removes liquidity from the pool.
  - **Operation Code**: `RM_LIQ = 0x70`

- **CLAIM_ALL_FEES Operation**: Allows the operator to claim all fees.
  - **Operation Code**: `CLAIM_ALL_FEES = 0x80`

### Masks for `ALL` Operations
- **Minimum Token Amount**:
  - `ALL_MIN_BOUND = 0x01` (with mask `0001`)
  
- **Maximum Token Amount**:
  - `ALL_MAX_BOUND = 0x02` (with mask `0010`)

For an intricate understanding, consider examining the `Ops` library's source code.
